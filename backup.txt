            <p>
            I am a part of the <b>Systems and Insights Group</b> where I primarily work in the
            Systems area. My current focus is on building <b>large scale systems for generative models</b> to enhance the resource efficiency of generative models
            and building <b>efficient inference serving systems.</b> I also work for <b>System Reliability Research</b> where</a> I work on building ML-bsased tools 
            to <b>predict cloud outages</b> and use causal techniques for <b>cloud failure diagnosis</b> to enhance the reliability and availability of distributed cloud systems.
